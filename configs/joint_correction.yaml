# Joint Correction Configuration
# Used by joint_correction.py to reorient URDF frames and fix joint axes.

# ─── Global rotation ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Defines the rotation from the CAD export base frame to the desired convention.
#
# base_frame describes how the CAD export axes map to the real world:
#   x, y, z: one of "forward", "back", "left", "right", "up", "down"
#
# The script computes the rotation needed to reach the target convention:
#   X = forward, Y = left, Z = up
#
# Example: Onshape robot_v1 exports with X=right, Y=forward, Z=up
# which requires Rz(-90°) to reach X=forward, Y=left, Z=up.

base_frame:
  x: left
  y: back
  z: up

# ─── Axis conventions ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Maps joint name keywords to desired rotation axes.
#
# Each entry is a keyword (matched case-insensitive against joint name)
# mapped to the desired axis: "X", "Y", or "Z".
#
# If a joint name contains multiple keywords, the first match wins.
# Joints that match no keyword get their axis inferred from the
# closest standard axis to the physical rotation direction.

axis_conventions:
  pitch: Y
  knee:  Y
  elbow: Y
  roll:  X
  yaw:   Z
